# Sabre-File-Arranger
This Python script finds the most recent file in a folder matching BID_BATCH_EXTRACT_*.zip.gpg, then copies it to a target directory. The file is renamed to include its last modified timestamp, ensuring traceability and avoiding duplicates. Ideal for automating batch archive tracking.
